                    <p>The completion of work will be dependent on the commission type and workload of commissions. It may typically average from 2 weeks to 3 months. Deadlines and timelines will be adhered to in good faith but may not be possible due to extenuating circumstances. Note that each project my vary. Please plan your launches and streams accordingly.</p>

                    <p>There may be 2 major revisions for each item shown during the process, not including mistakes made by the artist. Revision later in the process, such as after line art, can only be minor. I will actively reach out for feedback. Additional charge may be required for further revisions that may impact the timeline of the project.</p>

                    <h5>COMMUNICATION</h5>
                    <p>Communication will take place throughout the entire project timeline with updates and bouncing ideas. I will typically ask for feedback when I have something to show. I will let you know if anything is causing delays or priority shifts in the project.</p>

                    <p>I will use Twitter/Discord DMs and track status updates on Trello to facilitate communication. I will usually respond quickly but may also take up to one week to provide a better, more concrete update.</p>

                    <p>Clients agree to provide all required art references, information and assets before work begins and during the process, otherwise the timeline may be affected.</p>
